# CUDA Static Map

A GPU-accelerated, statically-sized hash map implementation for CUDA-enabled devices, written in Rust. This library provides a high-performance associative container that runs operations like insert, find, and contains directly on the GPU.

## Status

🚧 **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** 🚧

*Waiting for the GPU kernel to finish compiling*

## Prerequisites

To run the Docker container with GPU support, ensure you have the following installed on your host system:

*   **NVIDIA GPU Drivers**: Your system must have compatible NVIDIA drivers installed. Verify with `nvidia-smi`.
*   **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: This is required for Docker to interact with your NVIDIA GPU.
